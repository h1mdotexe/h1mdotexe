Hello, I’m Anthony, but you can call me Ant if you prefer. I’m actively expanding my knowledge in Python and security techniques, particularly through APIs.
My ongoing projects involve creating a professional portfolio website and gradually constructing my home network. I’m eager to collaborate 💞️, learn, and contribute wherever I can. 

- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
 As an individual, I tend to be quiet and reflective, always considering my actions before taking them. 😊
